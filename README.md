# hello-world
Hi, My name is Andre Henderson, Hendo being the name I received in the military as an affectation by my platoon is what I generally go by to those im friendly with thus Hendo4short became a user name I started using as a call back to those happy days. 

I graduated with a 3.8(dean's list) in Applied Design with a greater expression in Digital art and Web Design from Fontbonne University.

The more I learn, the better I am  (I know, "Duh" right lol) so here I am working to master Github and maybe drawing an employer's attention to myself. 

Currently besides self training I'm looking for a team that would like to have an enthusiastic Web Developer trained in Html 5, CSS, and Javascript. I haven't reached the Frameworks level but for any employer willing to take a chance on me I learn quick and I love a good challenge.
